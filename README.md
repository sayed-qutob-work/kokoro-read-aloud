# Local Read-Aloud (Kokoro TTS)

Select text anywhere on Windows → **Ctrl+Alt+R** reads it aloud in a natural voice →
**Ctrl+Alt+S** stops. Fully local (model runs on CPU), no network calls at runtime,
no clipboard polling. Starts speaking ~0.5s after the hotkey.

        │               clipboard is always restored), POSTs it over localhost

alternatives, and every non-obvious design decision — read **AUDIT.md** before
changing anything.

## Hotkeys

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Alt+R` | Read the current selection (works in browsers, PDFs, editors, terminals) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+T` | Read the clipboard as-is |
| `Ctrl+Alt+S` | Stop |

## Setting up on a fresh Windows machine

1. **Install prerequisites** (all free):
   - [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check "Add to PATH"
   - [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases) — the `.msi`;
     make sure `C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG` ends up on PATH (Kokoro needs it for
     phonemization)
   - [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (per-user install is fine)

2. **Clone and install** (PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/sayed-qutob-work/kokoro-read-aloud.git C:\kokoro
   cd C:\kokoro
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Always use `env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip`, never bare `pip` — and quote any
   version specs (`pip install "kokoro>=0.9.4"`), because `>` is a redirect in
   PowerShell.

3. **First run** (downloads the ~330MB model from Hugging Face into the user cache,
   one time only):

   ```powershell
   env\Scripts\python.exe tts_server.py
   ```

   Wait for `[kokoro] ready on http://127.0.0.1:5111`, then select some text and
   press Ctrl+Alt+R (start `read_aloud.ahk` by double-clicking it first).

4. **Autostart**: Win+R → `shell:startup` → put a shortcut to
   `C:\kokoro\start_tts.vbs` there. It launches both processes hidden and logs the
   server to `server.log` (read that first whenever something misbehaves).

5. **Terminal reading** (optional): in VS Code settings, set
   `"terminal.integrated.copyOnSelection": true`. In Windows Terminal, set
   `"copyOnSelect": true`. This lets Ctrl+Alt+R work on terminal text, where
   simulating Ctrl+C is not an option (it means "interrupt" there).

6. **Mouse button** (optional): a Logitech G Hub macro bound to a spare button —
   on press: left-click down; on release: left-click up, then Ctrl+Alt+R. Then
   drag-selecting with that button reads the selection when released.

## Tuning

All knobs live in the config block at the top of `tts_server.py` (restart to apply),
and the important ones can be changed live without a restart:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5111/config -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"playback_speed":2.0}'
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5111/config    # current values + measured stats
```

- `playback_speed` — pitch-preserving speed-up applied after synthesis (default 1.8;
  effective rate = this × `model_speed`)
- `first_chunk_audio` — seconds of audio in the opening chunk; lower = faster start,
  choppier opening (default 2.0 ≈ 0.5s to first sound)
- `voice` — e.g. `af_heart`, `am_michael`, `bf_emma` (full list in `tts_server.py`)

**Important:** editing `tts_server.py` does nothing to a running server. Kill it,
verify port 5111 is free, then start it again — the procedure is in AUDIT.md §7.

## Credits & licensing

The code in this repository is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`). It builds on:

  [kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) library by hexgrad — Apache 2.0.
  Neither is redistributed here; the library installs from PyPI and the model
  downloads from Hugging Face on first run.
- [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) (GPL-3.0) — installed
  separately by the user, used by Kokoro for phonemization.
